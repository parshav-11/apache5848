#list of genres to a vector where each column corresponds to one possible value of the feature. This encoding is needed for feeding categorical data. In this case, we 
#store every different genre in columns that contain either 1 or 0. 1 shows that a movie has that genre and 0 shows that it doesn't. Let's also store this dataframe in 
#another variable since genres won't be important for our first recommendation system.
#For every row in the dataframe, iterate through the list of genres and place a 1 into the corresponding column
